# Gene and Mitochondial Regions (hg19)

## What is this file?

This file contains all [HGNC](http://www.genenames.org/) gene symbols and their respective gene regions based on the hg19 genome build.

## How was this file generated?

### Gene regions for chr1-22, chrX, and chrY

* All gene regions for chr1-22, chrX, and chrY were generated from the hg19 refFlat.txt file, which can be downloaded [here](http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/refFlat.txt.gz).
* Gene transcripts were used to create the gene regions
* If a gene contains multiple transcripts 
  * The **lowest transcript start position** was used as the starting position
  * The **highest transcript end position** was used as the ending position

### Mitochondrial gene regions (chrM)

* All gene regions for chrM were take from the [NIH Genetics Home Reference](http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/mitochondrial-dna/show/Genes). Each region is written explicitly.
